# Selenite

Selenite is a multi-purpose set of Lua extensions developed to be used in the [Sandcat Browser](https://github.com/felipedaragon/sandcat) but that can also be used separately with any application. The project's goal is to make the development of Lua applications easier and to push the boundaries of the Lua language to do innovative things. This will always be a work in progress with new additions and regular updates.

## Usage

You just need to load the library using `require "Selenite"`.

After this you can use any of the library's functions. For a list of functions, visit [here](https://github.com/felipedaragon/selenite/blob/master/docs/functions.md).

**Name Origin:** The name Selenite comes from the Greek words selene and lithos meaning "moon stone".
